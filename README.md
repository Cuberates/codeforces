# Codeforces
The following repository contains solutions for Codeforces online competitions. It is noted that some solutions will be direct interpretations of post-contest 
editorials, but there will be ones which are based on personal observations as well. 

The goal of this repository is to primarily serve as a handbook of notes for future competitions, but I hope it will be useful for people who are interested in Codeforces and competitive programming in general.
